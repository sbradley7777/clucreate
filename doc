Since this tool has being designed to be as much generic as possible (i.e. set up cluster using templates of any distro), there are some manual requirements that should be configured.

Requirements:
	
	- each template should not have any network card added to the virtual machine, but should have the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 with the following configuration:

	DEVICE=eth0
	BOOTPROTO=dhcp
	ONBOOT=yes 

	- each template should have a file /etc/sysconfig/network with ONLY the following configuration:

		NETWORKING=yes
		IPv6=no

	- each template should have NetworkManager and iptables disabled
